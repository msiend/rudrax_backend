📘 Project Documentation – QR + Geofencing Attendance System
1. 📌 Project Overview

A smart attendance system using QR code scanning and geofencing validation to mark employees’ attendance.

Employees scan a QR code placed at the office location.

The mobile app checks both QR code validity and GPS location (geofence validation).

Attendance is logged in the backend system and can be monitored via an admin panel (web).

2. 🎯 Features
2.1 Employee Features (Mobile App – React Native/Expo)

✅ Login/Authentication (JWT-based, role-based)

✅ QR Code Scan for attendance (camera integration)

✅ Geofencing Validation (check if user is inside allowed radius)

✅ View Attendance History (daily, weekly, monthly)

✅ Push Notifications (attendance success/failure, reminders)

2.2 Admin Features (Web + Backend)

✅ Admin Dashboard (attendance overview, charts, reports)

✅ Employee Management (CRUD employees, assign QR code, roles)

✅ Attendance Reports (date range, department, export CSV/PDF)

✅ Geofence Management (set office locations & radius in meters)

✅ QR Code Management (generate & refresh QR codes daily/weekly)

2.3 Backend Features (Node.js + Express + MySQL2)

✅ RESTful API Endpoints (auth, attendance, employees, geofence, QR)

✅ MySQL2 Database Models (employees, attendance, geofence, QR logs)

✅ JWT Authentication & Role-based Access

✅ Validation & Error Handling

✅ Logs & Monitoring (audit logs for attendance)
